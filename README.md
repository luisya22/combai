# 🐝 Swarmlet
Swarmlet is a lightweight Go framework for building and orchestrating intelligent, multi-agent systems. Inspired by swarm intelligence, it enables agents to think, communicate, use tools, and coordinate workflows — all in a composable and scalable way.

Whether you're building autonomous assistants, workflow managers, or AI-powered backend services, Swarmlet gives you the foundation to define agents, assign tools, plug in memory or LLMs, and orchestrate complex multi-step plans with ease.

✨ Key Features
Composable Agent Architecture – Create agents with custom behavior, memory, and tool access.

Swarm Orchestration – Coordinate agents to work together on tasks or plans.

LLM Integration – Plug in any LLM (OpenAI, local, etc.) for reasoning and language-based action.

Tool System – Define tools with structured input/output and assign to agents.

Memory & Context – Support for external memory (vector DBs, context stores).

Flexible Execution – Run agents directly, in workflows, or under orchestrator supervision.
